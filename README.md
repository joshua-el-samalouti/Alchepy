Alchepy is still in early stages of development. Currently it includes:
- A 'Module' class that can handle all the necessary database operations and can load game data from a JSON file

An Alchepy module is the set of data of a game environment that's handled by Alchepy. This includes all contained elements and recipes as well as metadata

## What are the plans for Alchepy's future?
- A sample module to play and get a feel for the library
- Recipes with more than two input elements
- Recipes with more than one output element
- Recipe labels
- Methods to save and load progress
- Conditional events
- Additional commands for the console app
- A guide to module creation
